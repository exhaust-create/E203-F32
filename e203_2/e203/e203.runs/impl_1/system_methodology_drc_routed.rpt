TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_mmcm and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_mmcm] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out2_mmcm are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_mmcm]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_mmcm and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_mmcm] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree

Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.
